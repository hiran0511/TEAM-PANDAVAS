Rainfall Prediction Project üåßÔ∏è
This project aims to predict rainfall patterns for Indian cities using historical rainfall data from 2022 to 2024. The dataset includes daily observations for multiple cities and contains columns such as date, city, region, rainfall in millimeters, temperature, humidity, wind speed, pressure, cloud cover, and dew point. The project implements both ARIMA, a time-series statistical model, and LSTM, a deep learning model, to forecast rainfall for the next 7 days. Users can select any city in the dataset, and the script will display static rainfall trend plots using Seaborn as well as interactive plots using Plotly. The ARIMA model is saved as a .pkl file, while the LSTM model is saved as a .h5 file, enabling easy reuse without retraining. The project also demonstrates data cleaning, visualization, model training, and forecasting in a single, modular Python script. This workflow allows for easy extension to other cities, additional features, or longer forecasting horizons, making it suitable for analyzing seasonal patterns and supporting decision-making in areas affected by rainfall variability.
